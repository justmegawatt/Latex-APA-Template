# LaTeX APA Template
This is a LaTeX template file that mostly fits APA standards according to: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html

When I am made to write an essay, instead of creating the APA outline from scratch, it's better to just use a template. This is the APA template I use with LaTeX. It _mostly_ fits APA standards, I have not gotten everything to work. From my experience, the reviewers don't take off too many points, if any, from the minor APA format errors in my papers. This is simply made for myself to use, if you use it, then I hold no liability or responsibility from any results you get.
